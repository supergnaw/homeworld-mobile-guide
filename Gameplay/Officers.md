# Officers List & explanation

Officers in Homeworld Mobile give various buffs depending on the location they are placed in, what stats they have and if they have passive perks or active abilities.

## Stats

There are three stats that officer have, are [Physical](#physical), [Mind](#mind) and [Aerospace](#aerospace). These affect various items or actions in Homeworld Mobile at a rate of 0.05% per point (5% per 100 points) in a stat related to what it is being used in.

Stats do ***NOT*** apply from the Bridge.

### Physical

- **Kinetic weapons** (e.g. K-A3 Turret, Twin Javelin Cannon, Karos-8 Battery) - gives a damage buff to both hull and armour damage when slotted into a kinetic turret.
- **Ion weapons** (e.g. Crimson-4 Array, Fleet Model X2 Battery) - gives a damage buff to both hull and armour damage.
- **Pulsar weapons** (e.g. LT-4 MAG Pointer, Yaot SSL Pointer, DR-3 MAG Repeater, Yaot SSV Repeater) - gives a damage buff to both hull and armour damage when slotted into a pulsar turret.
- **Resource collectors** - mining yield increase for collectors when slotted into a resource collectors slot.
- **Resource controller** - remote mining yield increase for controllers when slotted into a resource controller slot.
- **Escort** - damage increase for escort ships when slotted into the escort slot but the buff type depends on the type of escort.

### Mind

- **Fabricator** - fabrication time reduction
- **Refinery** - refinery time reduction
- **Laboratory** - research time reduction

### Aerospace

- **Missile weapons** (e.g. Type-5 Launch Pads, Colchis Launch Clusters, Thundercloud Launch Complex) - increases the range of the turret.
- **Repair turrets** (e.g. REL-12, REL-12DX Twin, REL-14F Mohaava, REL-14XF Matter Projector) - increases the range of the turret.
- **Engine** - increases speed and acceleration.
- **Sensor array** - increases the scan strength for both system and galaxy scans.
- **Strike craft** - increases both hull and armour damage of a (combat) strike craft.

## Active Abilities

Operator officers also can have active abilities. If an officer has a symbol underneath the stats, it indicates an active ability. For this to be used, a player needs to place the officer on the bridge and have the right turret equipped on their flagship. The use of these in battle then costs energy to activate. Active abilities do not stack.

***Cooldowns on active abilities currently do not appear to work***

## Perks

- Officers with perks will generally outperform a higher stat officer for a slotted position
- If you do not have an officer for a certain slot, placing a high stat officer in that slot will suffice. For example, placing miners with a high physical stat on your turrets is a good alternative if you do not have a gunner with the right perk.
- You can stack perks on your bridge slots, for example, 4 officers with Fabrication Cost Reduction will work to reduce the costs of all blueprints.
- Although you can place officers in the hanger slot nothing (no stats or perks) is currently applied from this slot.
- On a side note, it seems that kinetic / mass driver officers also buff the damage for destroyer escorts.

When levelling up officers, you should be aware of the possibility of [split perks](#split-perks), where the officer gains a second perk.

### Comms Officer Perks

## Leveling Up

Every time you upgrade an officer, their stats increase. Every 10th upgrade, increases their perk (Ability cooldown reduction, perk buff increase), or has the possibility of adding an addition perk. See [Split Perks](#split-perks) for details.

## Split Perks

When levelling up officers, there is a small possibility that instead of increasing the stats of the perk, the officer will gain a second perk.

When officers do gain a second perk (referred to as a "split"), it is always from the same pool of perks in that officer's category. For instance, a gunner will only ever gain other gunner perks, and miners will only ever gain other miner perks. Some pools of perks are larger than others (gunners, miners and pilots have way more perks than Scientists, for instance) and the larger pools help to ensure that there are more useless perk combinations.

In most cases this splittng to a second perk is undesirable as it effectively ruins the officer and nullifies the insignia and credits spent on them; the officer gains a second perk at a mediocre level and leaves the primary perk at the previous level. In addition, any future levelling becomes a further gamble becasue which perk is levelled is random.

Officers with two perks **never** develop a third perk and operator officers **never** gain another active ability. Named market and event officers with two perks **should** always level the same way for everyone (i.e., not randomly).

There are good combinations of perks to be had but these are not common, for instance:

- Pulsar/kinetic hull damage officer gaining the pulsar/pinetic armour damage perk.
- An operator officer gaining an escort hull damage / armour damage / range perk.

There are also debatable combinations of perks that might be useful in some situations, for example:

- Refinery time officer gaining refinery cost.
- A/B/C ore mining officers gaining perks for other ore types.
- Research production officers gaining research time perks.

While there are some combinations that will want to make you give up, such as:

- Missile hull damage officer gaining the missile armour damage perk.
- Pulsar/Kinetic/Ion hull/armour damage officer gaining missile armour damage perk.
- Almost any gunnery officer gaining a perk from a different weapon type.
- Fabrication time officers gaining refinery time perks.
- Fighter squadron hull damage officers gaining corvette based perks (and vice-versa).
- Flagship acceleration/speed officers gaining fabrication time perks.

## Officer list

All officers obtained in the game, except for the named market legendary officers and the named event officers are now randomly generated, with random names, random pictures, random stats, and the ability to randonly gain (split) to a different perk every 10 levels. Due to this, it is no longer possible to maintain fixed officer lists for any officers other than event and market officers.
