# Systems

Homeworld mobile is set around a bunch of systems that are owned by various factions. On this page, there are lists of the various systems, who owns them, what tier they represent, if they have an Trade station or a outpost, whether there are asteroid belts, the number of all and the number of mineable Jovian planets, moons, what hyperspace jump strength is needed to jump to these systems and the designated 'difficulty' of the system.

Every system above T0 (Hiigaran) has access to faction liaison missions via an outpost or trading station, but only trade stations have access to a shipyard and faction liaison requisition shops.

## Hiigaran Faction

The Hiigaran faction, marked with blue, staked their claim on the south west of the known galactic map. They are the only faction with access to T0 systems, which are the only locations that have T0 M ore. All systems except their 'capital' system of Lazarus have asteroid belts. But only Lazarus has a trade station with access to a shipyard. The Hiigaran faction currently does not have liaison missions.

T0 systems are the only systems with T0 M ore, this does not need to be refined for use

### Hiigaran Lore

This is excluding lore from the main game titles, just what is found on the various loading screen segments.

- One in three Hiigaran expeditions sent through the gates to other galaxies fail to return. Nimbus has an exceptionally poor ratio.
- The name for the Nimbus Galaxy originates from the Hiigarans. The name was known to the ancients on Hiigara itself.
- The Lazarus Expedition of 9631 GSY was the largest and best-prepared expedition sent to Nimbus. It was the only time a full mothership ventured there.
- Joanna Naabal was sixteen when the Vaygr bombarded Hiigara. She lived for several hours in fear that a Vaygr missile would strike her house.
- Ahab Naabal, father of Joanna, is one of the prominent Hiigaran fleet admirals and proponent for Hiigaran unified expeditions.
- Joanna chafed against the safe postings given to her by her father. Two rotations in frigate command taught her the vulnerability of these ships.
- Admiral Enoch S’jet was the captain of a destroyer during the final battle against the Vaygr over Hiigara.
- To this day nobody is certain where the Vaygr acquired the planet killers they used against Hiigara in the final days of the war.
- Vashti Soban left Kiith S’jet because she disagreed with her Kiith’s disposition after the war. She believes Karan should have done more to unite their people.
- Few know that the Eye of Aarran is damaged. Karan S’jet is said to be seeking ways to repair it.
- There are functional hyperspace gate connections not on the network controlled by the Eye of Aarran.

## Iyatequa Faction

The Iyatequa faction, marked with brown, are mainly traders in the center of the Nimbus universe. They seem to have a close relation with the [Hiigarans](#hiigaran-faction), as can be seen with Hiigaran units protecting their stations and interest. All there systems have liaison missions, and their belts seems to be the main target of [Cangacian](#cangacian-faction) pirates. All systems of the Iyatequa have liaison offices

### Iyatequa Lore

- The Iyatequa traders are not native to this area. They maintain outposts and trade stations but do not have planetary possessions.
- The Iyatequa have little to no respect for outsiders. Every relationship with them is transactional.
- The Iyatequa’s reputation as providers extends nearly to all things, and they have few ethical standards.
- The Iyatequa can trade in anything, from Progenitor relics to slaves and access to corrupt politicians.
- The Iyatequa currency database contains thousands of currencies- including many from empires that have gone extinct.
- It is widely believed the Iyatequa unmask only in front of family-kind, but they do not reveal this information to outsiders.
- Nobody knows how the Iyatequa can see through their masks.
- The Iyatequa masks contain highly complex rank ornamentation, based on merit of the trader and accomplishments over their career.
- It is rumored that Iyatequa rank-ornamentation displays debts others owe to that particular trader.

## Tanoch Faction

The Tanoch, marked with yellow, are an imperial faction that seems to be in a conflict with the [Yaot](#yaot-faction). They are located on the north of the known map. Their liaisons are mostly based to counter the [Cangacian](#cangacian-faction) pirate and [Yaot](#yaot-faction) threats. All systems of the Tanoch have liaison offices.

### Tanoch Lore

- The current Tanoch Empire has existed for over eight thousand years.
- The Tanoch believe Star Totek, the Holy Star, contains the dead spirit of one of their ancient gods.
- The Tanoch are a deeply religious people, bound by faith to the Priest class and the Emperor who is descended from the gods.
- There are three sub-cultures within the Tanoch Empire: The ruling Tanoch, the liberal Chicuat, and the downtrodden Tecuban.
- The Temple forces within the Tanoch Empire answer only to Itaca Taot, High Priest of the Empire.
- The centuries-long conflict between the [Yaot](#yaot-faction) and the Tanoch is centered on a group of Progenitor relics known as the Five Pillars.
- In the Tanoch sky, Star Totek is part of a constellation known as the Eye of Xajaak- a creator deity whose hand is said to shape what is.

### Tanoch Lore (Winter Celebrations Event)

- The Tanoch Empire is approximately eight thousand years old; records are unclear even among the Tanoch themselves. They are currently led by an Emperor who is advised by a council of priests and high officials.
- The Tanoch are deeply religious people who are deferral to central authority figures and are skeptical of technology. The Tanoch Empire has repeatedly crushed dissidents and suppressed technological innovation in order to maintain their previous way of life.
- The Tanoch are worshiping the Progenitors, whom are known as the Makers within Nimbus. This worship is prominent across the entire Tanoch culture. At certain times, the Tanoch go on a pilgrimage to Star Totek which is said to house the spirit of the Makers.
- The Tanoch Empire is compromised broadly of three different ethnic groups. The Tanoch now control the Empire and are the most pious. The Tanoch Empire also inhibits the Chicuat who are seen as second-class citizens by the Tanoch and are often scapegoated of acts of disobedience, and the even lower-class Techuban who are survivors of the Tanoch Empire's ancient conquests.
- Recently a beloved Tanoch King died under mysterious circumstances. Therefore, the leadership of the Tanoch Empire has passed onto his young son Cazoma.

## Yaot Faction

The Yaot faction, marked in green, are a mostly unknown faction but seems to be in an aggressive conflict with the [Tanoch](#tanoch-faction). They are focused on the south, and have the most T3 systems of any faction. Their liaisons are mostly based to counter the [Cangacian](#cangacian-faction) pirates and [Tanoch](#tanoch-faction) incursions. All systems of the Yaot have liaison offices.

### Yaot Lore

- The Yaot Federation is a Gerontocracy, ruled by a council of the eldest from every major house. No member is younger than 60.
- The centuries-long conflict between the Yaot and the [Tanoch](#tanoch-faction) is centered on a group of Progenitor relics known as the Five Pillars.

### Yaot Lore (Astral Conjunctions Event)

- The Yaot:
  - The Yaot Federation is a technologically advanced gerontocracy galactic south of their mortal enemies, the Tanoch Empire.
  - Both civilizations are in contention over five massive Progenitor relics known as the Pillars. This conflict of varying intensity has been going on for close to three hundred years.
- The conjunctions:
  - Yaotl, the Home system of the Yaot Federation, is populated with twelve planets and over two hundred and twenty asteroids and moonlets.
  - Since ancient days, the Yaot have believed the conjunctions of the different planets and stars in their sky forecast signs and portents of events to come. Celebrations and festivals are timed to specific conjunctions, making it one of the most significant holidays to the Yaot people.
- The Ram:
  - One of the most dire conjunctions of stars in the Yaot sky is the Ram, which portents great upheaval on the horizon and a warning to leaders and members of the religiously inclined.
  - Three times in the history of the Yaot, great social change and calamity has coincided with the appearance of this conjunction.
  - The conjunction is due to appear soon, and many are already worried about what tragedy will befall the Yaot people. The council of elders, naturally, has dismissed the superstition.
- The government:
  - The Federation is a union of a hundred and eighty or so "old families" which are ruled by a council of firstborn elders from each family.
  - No member is younger than sixty, making the council of late increasingly out of touch with the needs of the people.
  - Already social unrest from the young is building over resentment of fighting a religious war that is increasingly unpopular.

## Amassari Faction

The Amassari faction, marked in yellow, are the degenerated descendants of the formidable Haktar Empire. They are focused on the north east beyond the Nightmare Gulf. Their liaisons are mainly against [Kithless Hiigarans](#kiithless-hiigaran-faction) and other Amassari. Their siege frigates are to be feared; on their own, they have been known to one-shot unwary resource collectors, while groups are eaily a match for the hardiest flagship.

### Amassari Lore

- The Amassari live amongst the ruins of their shattered empire and progenitor derelicts.
- There is almost no widespread technological advancement among the Amassari becasue materials are so scarce.
- The Amassari have lost the knowledge of scientific experimentation.
- They continue on maintaining their ships through a mixture of tradition and religious practices.

## Cangacian Faction

The Cangacian faction, marked in red, made their wretched hives of scum and villainy in the north west of the known map. They have a special outpost called 'safe haven' that gives you a nice little flavor text when you enter the system. As you could expect, outside of the safe haven, cangacians seem to attack you quite a lot in their space. They currently have no liaison offices, nor should you even be willing to support the pirate menace.

## Kiithless Hiigaran faction

Very little is known of this faction at this time, although their paintjob rocks.

## Progenitor Faction

Although the Progenitors don't have their own systems (yet?), They can be found in various scannable signals throughout Nimbus.

The Keeper is aware. The Keeper understands. The Keeper has seen the enemy.

### Progenitor Lore

This is excluding lore from the main game titles, just what is found on the various loading screen segments.

- There are too many conflicting theories behind the fall of the Progenitor empire to ever conclusively establish what destroyed them.
- Few survive an encounter with a Progenitor keeper. Most that do always accomplish the feat through desperation and outside help.
- It is widely rumored the Progenitors had weapons capable of stupefying levels of destruction. No Progenitor planets have ever been found.
- The Hyperspace Gate network is the most visible and lasting accomplishment of the ancient Progenitor Empire.
- Free standing artifacts that are gate-like have been identified and known for centuries as ‘gates’, but their purpose wasn’t revealed until Aarran was opened.

### Ghost Stories

#### The Gold Fleet

There is a legend among the Tanoch from the old days of conquest, about the Golden fleet and the Emperor of the time: Altozac the radiant. It is said that before he bombarded Taldonac VI, the wizard-king of that world put a curse on Altozac and his fleet. After the surface of Taldonac was turned to molten glass, the gold fleet jumped to hyperspace and never returned home.

Sightings of the gold fleet have been reported through the millennia, mostly from a distance. They never respond to hails and they don’t always appear on sensors, but they are reported as always moving towards Tanochet broadcasting strange signals. Attempts have been made to discern the fleet’s fate, but no concrete evidence has ever been found. The only thing that remains of the Gold Fleet are rumors and sightings across Tanoch space.

#### The Pariah

The Iyatequa are known across Nimbus space as traders and dealers of all kinds of wares and goods. Generally they are welcomed, even if they are kept at arms reach, and one can always have goods to buy from them. But there is one Iyatequa tradesman known as Cosoca the Green with whom you must never barter with.

His deals are fantastic on the surface- promising riches and wealth to those who would only part with their modest, simple belongings. Too many find out after their deals that their loved ones at home have disappeared, leaving only scraps of evidence of what became of them. Even the most guarded individuals who choose to deal with Cosoca the Green have seen their loved ones vanish without a trace. It is said Cosoca is a cursed God, trapped in the form of this cursed tradesman, harvesting souls of the innocent for some great penance he committed in times forgotten.

#### The Israfil

There are sightings around the Empty Quarter and into Tanoch space of a large vessel of unknown design, about the size of a destroyer. It shows signs of damage from a space battle long ago, with the cargo bays breached and the fuel bays long emptied. Boarding the ship reveals the presence of the long-dead crew, a sealed compartment impervious to all attempts to breach it, and a low-level energy signature of indeterminate location. The logs are too jumbled to read clearly, but it can be learned the ship’s name is the Israfil, it was bound for a planet called Erarat with a cargo of Raw materials some one million years ago.

There are hundreds of encounters with this ship but never in the same place- sometimes many thousands of light years from its last reported location. Crews attempting to salvage the ship often report odd and unsettling occurrences ultimately driving them from the derelict. The ship has claimed the lives of over forty salvagers who have vanished when exploring the ship.

#### Whisper Pearls

Scattered through the empty quarter are odd gravity anomalies the Cangacian call Whisper Pearls. It is believed they are one of the few catalogued gravity anomalies littered in Nimbus which inhibit casual hyperspace drive (necessitating stronger engines to conduct hyperspace travel). Whisper pearls are unusual in that, in addition to their gravimetric properties, they also broadcast legible transmissions.

What’s unsettling about them is that they broadcast signals that have been trapped there for centuries, possibly millenia. Some of these signals appear to eminate from long-dead civilizations or starships that have long since been destroyed. Since the pearls can be found orbiting large stellar masses and other black-body phenomina invisible to sensors, they have been known to draw would-be rescuers and the curious to their deaths when they try to steer a quantum wave towards them to investigate..
