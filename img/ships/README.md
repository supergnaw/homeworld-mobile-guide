# Adding Ship Screenshots

## Proper Screenshot Guidelines

In order to maintain consistency accross all screenshot submissions of fleet ships, a small set of guidelines have been created:

### Formatting

- Must be cropped with ship centered within image.
- No GUI elements or other ships can be within the frame.
- No health bars must be visible.
